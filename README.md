## ‚≠ê Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to get myself into the habit of solving leetcode questions daily.

## ü•Ö Goals

### C#
I am solving the questions in C# as I wanted to solidify my C# knowledge for future job positions that require a full stack .NET developer.

### Interview Preparations
Another goal is to be prepared for interviews. I learn the best when I take apart a solution and understand the inner workings of an algorithm or datastructure.
Working on questions daily will help me achieve this result.
